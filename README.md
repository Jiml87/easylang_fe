# Goal

User should have an opportunity to learn new words to efficient way.
Simply add any word you want to learn, and the app will
schedule reminders to review it on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 30th
day. Plus, with smart AI-driven tasks, user'll practice
using the word in context, making it easier to retain and
understand.

## Motivation

* A user should be able to save a new word very quickly without long loading times of the application.
Any new features should not negatively impact this capability!!!
* Keep an eye on mobile version
